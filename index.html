      Hi, everyone! </br>
      This is Robert's demo page. </br>
      Robert is one of those people who has resisted thinking in terms of favorites ever since his third grade teacher insisted that Robert must have a favorite color even though Robert was quite sure that he didn't prefer any one color to another. Robert is, however, open to the idea of temporary favorites, so Robert is willing to say that his favorite singer of the moment is Madeleine Peyroux, though this will probably have changed by the time you read this.
